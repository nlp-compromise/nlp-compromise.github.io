  `Hipcroft with an intensity which would scarcely allow him time to pack`,
  `business of his over-hours to stand about in by-streets in the hope of`,
  `discovering her, and would start up in the night, saying, 'That rascal'sLess than 3 weeks ago, I joined you on the West Front of this very building and, looking over the monuments to our proud past, offered you my hand in filling the next page of American history with a story of extended prosperity and continued peace.`,
  `And tonight I'm back to offer you my plans as well.`,
  `Here, 22 years ago, I first raised my hand to be sworn into public life.`,
  `So, tonight I feel as if I'm returning home to friends.`,
  `And I intend, in the months and years to come, to give you what friends deserve: frankness, respect, and my best judgment about ways to improve America's future.`,
  `The people didn't send us here to bicker, and it's time to govern.`,
  `And 8 years ago, I sat in that very chair as President Reagan spoke of punishing inflation and devastatingly high interest rates and people out of work — American confidence on the wane.`,
  `We're fortunate — a much changed landscape lies before us tonight.`,
  `And so, tonight we must take a strong America and make it even better.`,
  `Some people find that agenda impossible, but I'm presenting to you tonight a realistic plan for tackling it.`,
  `Next year alone, thanks to economic growth, without any change in the law, the Federal Government will take in over $80 billion more than it does this year.`,
  `We can afford to increase spending by a modest amount, but enough to invest in key priorities and still cut the deficit by almost 40 percent in 1 year.`,
  `I make this pledge tonight: My team and I are ready to work with the Congress, to form a special leadership group, to negotiate in good faith, to work day and night — if that's what it takes — to meet the budget targets and to produce a budget on time.`,
  // `And I ask the Congress tonight to approve several measures which will make budgeting more sensible.`,
  // `Several principles describe the kind of America I hope to build with your help in the years ahead.`,
  // `Three weeks ago, we celebrated the bicentennial inaugural, the 200th anniversary of the first Presidency.`,
  // `We must take actions today that will ensure a better tomorrow.`,
  // `I propose almost $2.2 billion for the National Science Foundation to promote basic research and keep us on track to double its budget by 1993.`,
  // `I want to cut that dropout rate and make America a more literate nation, because what it really comes down to is this: The longer our graduation lines are today, the shorter our unemployment lines will be tomorrow.`,
  // `So, tonight I'm proposing the following initiatives: the beginning of a $500 million program to reward America's best schools, merit schools; the creation of special Presidential awards for the best teachers in every State, because excellence should be rewarded; the establishment of a new program of National Science Scholars, one each year for every Member of the House and Senate, to give this generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and mathematics; the expanded use of magnet schools, which give families and students greater choice; and a new program to encourage alternative certification, which will let talented people from all fields teach in our classrooms.`,
  // `And tonight, I'd ask you to join me by becoming the Education Congress.`,
  // `Just last week, as I settled into this new office, I received a letter from a mother in Pennsylvania who had been struck by my message in the Inaugural Address.`,
  // `Not 12 hours before, she wrote, my husband and I received word that our son was addicted to cocaine.`,
  // `Over 23 million Americans used illegal drugs last year, at a staggering cost to our nation's well-being.`,
  // `And I am asking tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget outlays to escalate the war against drugs.`,
  // `Some will be used to cut the waiting time for treatment.`,
  // `And so, tonight I'm calling for the indefinite postponement of three lease sales which have raised troubling questions, two off the coast of California and one which could threaten the Everglades in Florida.`,
  // `There's another issue that I've decided to mention here tonight.`,
  // `Earlier this week, I announced my support for a plan to restore the financial and moral integrity of our savings system.`,
  // `I ask Congress to enact our reform proposals within 45 days.`,
  // `We face a massive task in cleaning up the waste left from decades of environmental neglect at America's nuclear weapons plants.`,
  // `We've been fortunate during these past 8 years.`,
  // `America is a stronger nation than it was in 1980.`,
  // `Most people don't realize that after the successful restoration of our strength, the Pentagon budget has actually been reduced in real terms for each of the last 4 years.`,
  // `In light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit, however, I support a 1-year freeze in the military budget, something I proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan.`,
  // `And this freeze will apply for only 1 year, and after that, increases above inflation will be required.`,
  // `I should be clear on the conditions attached to my recommendation for the coming year: The savings must be allocated to those priorities for investing in our future that I've spoken about tonight.`,
  // `I've directed the National Security Council to review our national security and defense policies and report back to me within 90 days to ensure that our capabilities and resources meet our commitments and strategies.`,
  // `Securing a more peaceful world is perhaps the most important priority I'd like to address tonight.`,
  // `Never before in this century have our values of freedom, democracy, and economic opportunity been such a powerful and intellectual force around the globe.`,
  // `Our diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.`,
  // `I've asked the Secretary of State to visit Europe next week and to consult with our allies on the wide range of challenges and opportunities we face together, including East-West relations.`,
  // `When I served as our representative in China 14 or 15 years ago, few would have predicted the scope of the changes we've witnessed since then.`,
  // `He was speaking of his country, decades ago, but his words speak to each of us in America tonight.`,
  // `And to the young people of America, who sometimes feel left out, I ask you tonight to give us the benefit of your talent and energy through a new program called YES, for Youth Entering Service to America.`,
  // `To the families of America watching tonight in your living rooms, hold fast to your dreams because ultimately America's future rests in your hands.`,
  // `And tomorrow the debate on the plan I've put forward begins, and I ask the Congress to come forward with your own proposals.`,
  // `Recalling anniversaries may not be my specialty in speeches but tonight is one of some note.'`,
