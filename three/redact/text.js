export default `Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"

I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie "Yo', Holmes, smell ya later"
I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air`
